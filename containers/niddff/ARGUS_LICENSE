Argus-3.0 is a derivative work of argus-2.0 and uses technology developed for libpcap tcpdump, tcp_wrappers-6.3, and GNU software.

Thanks continue to go to the principle authors of these packages, Steve McCanne (mccanne@ee.lbl.gov), Craig Leres (leres@ee.lbl.gov), Van Jacobson (van@ee.lbl.gov) and Wietse Venema (wietse@wzv.win.tue.nl) for their exceptional work, without which, Argus would have had to do a lot more work.

Along with the author contact information, we have included the copyrights and licensing terms that apply to the various components of Argus. Please refer to the individual packages, for specific use and redistribution limitations thsat may apply.
